# The 8080 and it relatives
## Donovan

#### 8080
* The 8080 was not the first microprocessor, but its predecessors were so restricted
* When the 8080 released, it was significant, as there wass now a CPU contained in a single package selling for a little more than $100
* Despite that, it's instruction set was most notable
    * It was easy to learn and easy to use, becoming the industry standared
* However, the 8080 was not all great, as its IC had significant shortcomings. 
    * It was slow, required three different power supply voltages, and needed extra IC's to provide clocks and system control

#### 8085
* When Intrl released the 8085 microprocessor, it maintained its predecessor's instruction set.
* The 8085 greatly simplified its predecessor's problems, needing only at +5 volt power supply and a capacitor between pins 1 and 2 to run
* Gretest improvement by the 8085 was simplification in hardware design and increase in operating speed

Later members of the 8080 families will be reviewed in part 3, but the important thing is the CP/M is written using 8080 instructions.
