# CP/M Chapter 8 Notes

## The National Semiconductor NSC800
* The designers of the National NSC800 had it easy
    * Examined other's products and built off of them
    * Little personal innovation
* Borrowed IC pinouts from the 8085
* Borrowed the super instruction set from the Z80
* NSC 800 os a CMOS integrated circuit
    * Can run using a fraction of the power its predecessors needed (at a higher price)
* In conclusion, the NSC800 is a versatile and efficient tool, that contains the best of both worlds between the 8085 and Z80
