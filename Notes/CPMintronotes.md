# CP/M Assembly Language Programming Notes
## Preface and Introduction

### Preface
- Learning assembly language is not easy but it can be found everywhere:
	- Assembly is compact and has a high speed of execution
	- Assembly forces the user to think in machine compared to other languages that look like simple English
	- The use of assembly require you to study the internal structure of the machine and learn its instruction set

CP/M has simplififed the process to learn assembly language
* The language is portable and independent of hardware, meaning that no matter the moel being used, the environment will be similar
* CP/M makes all computers look alike
* Experimenting and making mistakes with a CP/M based computer is okay as it can't be damaged from the operator's console

### Introduction
- The keystrokes you are to make are displayed in bold
	- `cr` means you hit return on your console
- Mnemonics make it easier to read assembly source code
- A source program is keyed into a disk file using CP/M's ED.COM, then assembled by CP/M's ASM.COM
	- The editor and assembler provide the most error-free method of program generation

### Why Assemble
- Assembly is the best for intimate interfacing with the hardware
- Assembly is useful for:
	- Writing programs where minmal program size is needed
   	- Situtions where speed of execution is most important
### Required Materials
	- This book
	- CP/M based computer
        - Manual that accompanies the CP/M computer
        - Empty disk dedicated to exercises
	- Copy of "8080/8085 Assembly Language Programming Manual"
