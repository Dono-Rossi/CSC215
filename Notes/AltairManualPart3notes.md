# Part Three Notes

## A. Front Panel Switches & LEDs
### 1. Switches
* ON–OFF: Powers the machine on/off. Turning off erases memory. 
* STOP–RUN: Halts or starts program execution.
* SINGLE STEP: Executes one machine instruction at a time (each may span multiple cycles).
* EXAMINE / EXAMINE NEXT: Displays contents of the current or next memory location on the data LEDs.
* DEPOSIT / DEPOSIT NEXT: Stores data from the data switches into current or next memory address. Allows entry of new data before deposit.
* RESET / CLR: RESET sets the Program Counter to address 0. CLR clears for external I/O.
* PROTECT / UNPROTECT: Locks or unlocks memory from being changed.
* AUX Switches: Two unused switches reserved for future peripherals.
#### Data/Address switches
	* DATA (bits 7–0)
	* ADDRESS (bits 15–0). For a 256-word system, only bits 0–7 are used.
